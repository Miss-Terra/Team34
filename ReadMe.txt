5. Issues / Problems Encountered
	
Time management: 
Developing a game in 5 weeks is a challenge.
	
Graphics Design: 
Graphics is a major part, but we don't have experience working on it. Also it takes us lots of time working on it.
	
Communication Barrier:  
Team members have different ideas and we spent much time on making agreement.
	
Technologies: 
We had problems about how to use github at beginning, but we are fine now.
